** UNIVARIABLE ASSOCIATIONS **

* Neuroticism vs 18 outcomes
* Restricted cubic splines models, ORs for outcome x, of quartiles of N 
* and per 50 points of N
* Graphic demonstration

* Neuroticism vs 15 confounders
* Boxplots
* Will be shown in table, per quartiles of N


** ADJUSTED MODELS **

* Neuroticism vs 18 outcomes
* Restricted cubic splines models
* SAME adjustments (the 7 variables under CONFOUNDERS) for each outcome
* QUESTION: are there too many covariates, taking into account that some outcomes
* are very rare? Shall we best remove the covariable Chronic_somatic_disease_CA
* which is ALSO rare?


** NOTES **

* No multiple comparison correction planned. Rationale: outcomes have different 
* pathophysiology and do not belong to same hypothesis.
