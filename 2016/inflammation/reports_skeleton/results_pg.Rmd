## Introduction

## Methods

### Cohort

Due to a minimal number of twins and maternal smokers, we removed these subjects from all of our analyses.

### Outcome

Due to sample size limitations, our main outcome was x- vs x+. We then ran a sensitivity analysis with the cleaner outcome -- vs -+.

### Distribution of exposure

From observing the boxplots and QQ-plots (Figures S1-3), we decided that a log2 transformation was a reasonable transformation to ensure more Normal exposure distributions amongst the majority of the inflammation markers.

### DAPC

We attempted to identify genes that could discern between the two groups. To do so, we applied a discriminant analysis of principle components (DAPC) [@jombart_discriminant_2010] implemented in the R package adegenet [@jombart_adegenet:_2008].

We ran cross-validation with 300 replicates, withholding 10% of the data each time for validation. Within each cross-validation replicate, the optimal number of principle components (PCs) was chosen to best predict group membership in the validation data. We then applied a MANOVA test to the remaining PCs to identify if they could significantly differentiate between the outcomes. If so, we then ordered the inflammation factors by importance (determined by loading plots) and conducted a forward-selection procedure. Briefly, on step n: a multivariable logistic regression was performed containing the n most important inflammation factors. If the model was significant (tested via an F test), then the forward-selection procedure stopped and the final model was recorded.

We applied this testing methodology in the following strata: all the data, removing those with an earlier history of depression, removing those who took NSAIDs on the same day as blood collection, those with chronic inflammatory or rheumatic diseases, those who gave birth via a (planned?) caesarean.

### Logistic regressions and Bonferroni adjustment

We ran crude univariable logistic regressions between individual inflammation factors and the outcomes of interest. We then applied the Bonferroni adjustment to correct for multiple testing. To safeguard against non-clinically significant results, only those with statistically significant odds ratios larger than 1.05 (or smaller than 1/1.05) were displayed.

We applied this testing methodology in the following strata: all the data, removing those with an earlier history of depression, removing those who took NSAIDs on the same day as blood collection, those with chronic inflammatory or rheumatic diseases, those who gave birth via a (planned?) caesarean.

### LASSO and Elastic-Net

LASSO regression is a form of penalised regression that applies variable selection, however, when there are a number of highly collinear independent variables, tends to randomly select one.

Elastic-Net regression is another form of penalised regression that has a tuning variable, allowing the penalisation to vary between variable selection and shrinking the coefficients of a collinear group of independent variables together.

We applied both LASSO and Elastic-Net regression to our dataset, choosing the penalisation and tuning parameters via cross-validation with X replicates. To safeguard against non-clinically significant results, only those with statistically significant odds ratios larger than 1.05 (or smaller than 1/1.05) were displayed.

We applied this testing methodology in the following strata: all the data, removing those with an earlier history of depression, removing those who took NSAIDs on the same day as blood collection, those with chronic inflammatory or rheumatic diseases, those who gave birth via a (planned?) caesarean.

### Summary variable analyses

We constructed a summary variable for the pregnancy inflammation factors. Briefly, we transformed all of the log-inflammation factors into Z-scores (to account for different inflammation factor scales), we then assigned each person their mean inflammation factor Z-score (to summarize them), and then transformed this summary variable into a Z-score again (for interpretation purposes, so that 1 unit increase corresponds to a 1 standard deviation increase in mean inflammation factor Z-score).

We were interested in applying multivariable logistic regressions to the outcomes of interest. Adjustment variables were: age, abnormal BMI, education, chronic inflammatory or rheumatic disease, fasting at sample, pregnancy SSRI useage, earlier history of depression, baby sex, and pregnancy length. We had concerns that we were including too many variables for our small dataset, and therefore approached the modelling in four different ways. Firstly, we performed crude univariate analyses. We then applied LASSO logistic regression (using the standard method of selecting the penalisation parameter lambda, where it was selected to be the largest value such that the cross-validated error was within one standard-error of the minimum) to our dataset to perform variable selection, and then included these variables in a multivariable logistic regression. We then loosened the penalisation of LASSO and selected lambda corresponding to the smallest cross-validated error and repeated the process. We finally included all a priori selected variables in a full multivariable logistic regression.

We performed additional sensitivity analyses in a restricted cohort with no history of earlier depression.

## Results

We found no conclusive proof of a single inflammation factor having an association with the outcomes (Figure 1). Instead, it appeared as though the overall pregnancy inflammation level was associated with the outcomes (the majority of the crude univariable analyses showed a protective association, while the more complicated/variable selecting models showed no relationship). We therefore focused our energies on the summary variables representing overall inflammation level.

The outcome of x- and x+ and exposure of Z-score of mean pregnancy IF Z-scores were significantly associated with each other when running a crude analysis (OR=0.62; 95% CI=0.46 to 0.83). Standard LASSO regression did not select Z-score of mean pregnancy IF Z-scores as a meaningful predictor of post-partum depression, however, a more permissive LASSO regression selected Z-score of mean pregnancy IF Z-scores as the second most important variable after depression earlier in life. A subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis showed a significant association (OR=0.70; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96). However, when including all variables in a full multivariable logistic regression analysis, the association became non-significant (OR=0.79; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.10).
