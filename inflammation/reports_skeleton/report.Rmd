# Inflammation markers

We notice that the vast majority of the inflammation markers have a high percentage above the LOD. For further analyses, we exclude inflammation markers with less than 50% detection rate.
```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableLOD.RDS")
```

## Distribution and outliers

We observe boxplots and QQ-plots to better understand the distribution of the inflammation markers. A straight line in the QQ-plots infers a Normal distribution. We also investigate if a log2 transformation of the inflammation markers results in a more Normal distribution.

### Decision to use log2 of inflammation markers

From observing the QQ-plots, we believe that a log2 transformation is a reasonable transformation to ensure more Normal exposure distributions amongst the majority of the inflammation markers.

## Clusters

Here we use "hclustvar" from the package ClustOfVar[@chavent_clustofvar:_2012]. This function implements a singular value decomposition (SVD) approach of PCAMIX[@chavent_orthogonal_2012]. Briefly, the algorithm aims at maximizing a homogeneity criterion. A cluster of variables is defined as homogeneous when the variables in the cluster are strongly linked to a central quantitative synthetic variable. This link is measured by the squared Pearson correlation for the quantitative variables and by the correlation ratio for the qualitative variables.

We then need to choose how many clusters are suitable for our data. We do this via the "stability" function from the package ClustOfVar. The stability of X clusters is evaluated with a bootstrap approach. "hclustvar" is applied to 100 bootstrap samples. The partitions of the bootstrap samples are then compared to the original clustering. The mean of the corrected Rand indices is then used to determine an appropriate number of clusters.

## Association between outcomes and demographic variables

We recode the raw outcome (EPDS or MINI) to a binary outcome variable.
```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableRawOutcomeSensitive.RDS")
```

We recode the raw outcome (MINI) to a binary outcome variable.
```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableRawOutcomeSpecific.RDS")
```

We run logistic regressions to examine the associations between outcomes and demographic variables

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableDetailed_o_pp_sensitive_1.RDS")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableDetailed_o_pp_sensitive_2.RDS")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableDetailed_o_pp_sensitive_3.RDS")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableDetailed_o_pp_specific_1.RDS")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableDetailed_o_pp_specific_2.RDS")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableDetailed_o_pp_specific_3.RDS")
```

Identifying that our demographic variables are too detailed for our sparse dataset, we simplify age, parity, BMI, and breastfeeding then rerun the logistic regressions

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableSimple_o_pp_sensitive_1.RDS")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableSimple_o_pp_sensitive_2.RDS")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableSimple_o_pp_sensitive_3.RDS")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/tableSimple_o_pp_specific_1.RDS")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}

## Association between inflammation markers and demographic variables

## Association between outcomes (EPDS and MINI, MINI) and inflammation markers in pregnant women

We attempted to identify genes that could discern between the two groups. To do so, we applied a discriminant analysis of principle components (DAPC) [@jombart_discriminant_2010] implemented in the R package adegenet [@jombart_adegenet:_2008].

We ran cross-validation with 300 replicates, withholding 10% of the data each time for validation. Within each cross-validation replicate, the optimnal number of principle components (PCs) was chosen to best predict group membership in the validation data. We then observed if DAPC produced improved results over a random group allocation. If so, for the DAPC analysis using the cross-validated optimal number of PCs, we produced discrimination plots and subsequent loading plots for genes that had loadings over 1/(number of genes).

We consider the number of patients available for analysis:

## Summary of association between outcomes (EPDS and MINI, MINI) and inflammation markers in pregnant and post-partum women

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/dapc_crossvalidation.RDS")
```

The DAPC results indicate that inflammation factors in pregnancy can discriminate between healthy in post-partum and depressed post-partum (EPDS or MINI). However, there is not support for the hypothesis that inflammation factors in pregnancy can discriminate between healthy throughout versus healthy in pregnancy and depressed post-partum (EPDS or MINI). There is some support for the hypothesis that inflammation factors in pregnancy can discriminate between healthy throughout versus depressed in pregnancy (EPDS or MINI).

The DAPC results indicate that inflammation factors in post-partum can discriminate between healthy in post-partum and depressed post-partum (EPDS or MINI) as well as between healthy throughout versus depressed in pregnancy (EPDS or MINI). However, there is no support for the hypothesis that inflammation factors in post-partum can discriminate between healthy throughout versus healthy in pregnancy and depressed post-partum (EPDS or MINI). Using deduction on the longitudinal order of these events occurring, these results suggest that post-partum inflammation factors are discerning between healthy and depressed pregnant women, and other significant findings are due to correlations with this association.

```{r, echo=FALSE, strip.white=FALSE}
readRDS("../../../results/dapc_loadings.RDS")
```

The similarity between the post-partum inflammation factor loadings of "Healthy post-partum versus depressed post-partum (EPDS or MINI)" and "Healthy in pregnancy versus depressed in pregnancy (EPDS or MINI)" reinforce the indication that these two analyses are both discerning between healthy and depressed pregnant women.
